# useMemo hook

The `useMemo` hook in React is used to memoize a value. This means it can be used to optimize performance by caching the result of an expensive computation so that it only recalculates when its dependencies change. This can be particularly useful in preventing unnecessary re-renders or re-calculations within your components.
